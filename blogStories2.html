            <h2>Becoming What I Am Meant To Be</h2><br>
            My mentor Ralphael Mudau once said,<br>
            <div class="grayBoxnLined">
	            "The good thing about continuing is that you will eventually get there."
            </div><br>

            <p>
                No doubt I am ignorant to what it will take to be what I desire to be in the coming years, but as they say ignorance is bliss right?
                However, it can also prove to be a trap! Allow me to elaborate, we have all watched/seen/witnessed someone with a particular career that peeks
                our interest and gives us the motivation to follow the same career. This could be in real life or fiction, to be a technology based entrepreneur
                like Elon Musk or an industrialist/weapons manufacturer like Tony Stark... The sky is the limit.

                Personally I aim to engage in a conquest like Alexander the Great of Greece and build an empire like Julius Caesar of Rome. You might be asking what do
                these ancients have to do with technology? Well, I aspire to conquer the field of technology whether it be making cars, aeroplanes, robotics, better
                transport systems, educational resources, communications, defense systems, and the like. The goal is to build a technological empire under one brand 
                where all services can be aquired. I know crazy! You could say I am dreaming. However I am reminder of the saying in the Word of God that states,
                <div class="grayBoxnLined">"Many are the plans in a person's heart, but it is the LORD'S purpose that prevails." <br>-Proverbs 19:21</div><br>
            </p><br>
            <p>               
                That being said you might be wondering exactly what sort of career I will take to achieve this enormous milestone? Well, I will simply choose to be faithful
                to what I am learning and hopefully get a job maybe in the next 5years that will help re-enforce all that I have learnt so that I do not forget any of it.
                Then I will continue to add on more and more to my learning until I have an entire empire of technology in my hands. The reason I want to do this is so that
                people can easily get what they want fast instead of wasting valueable time searching on an endless list of technology brands. Also the world is moving
                towards "Globalization" with conspiracies of a "One World Government", so why not a "Globalization of Technology"? 
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Now you fully understand what I meant when I said ignorance is bliss and that it can prove to be a trap. However, continuing along that will either 
                eventually get me there or I will fall short somewhere but atleast I worked hard and tried.
