          <h1>Social Media??... Entertainment Is The Real Culprit!<br><span style="font-size: 16px;">By Moyo Ryan W.</span></h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                "Too much social media is bad", "Social Media is toxic", "I deactivated my social media", "Social media
                should be safeguarded", and so much more comments like these that place the blame on social media. Honestly,
                I believe it is not to blame rather it is the abundance of entertainment which is a poison... a drug I should
                say. A prescription is mandotary because it is too addictive. I am ashamed to say that I once was a social
                media-addict, spending <i>24hours</i>...That's right <b>A WHOLE DAY!</b> consuming it without sleeping. On
                second thought maybe I did sleep and didn't realize it... I was too "focused"! Do you now get my point?
            </p>
            <h2>Main</h2>
            <p >
                What is "Social Media" anyway? Well,
                <dl class="box">
                    <dt>Media:</dt>
                        <dd>is plural for medium.</dd>
                    <dt>Medium:</dt>
                        <dd>something that is used for a particular purpose.</dd>
                    <dt>Social:</dt>
                        <dd>connected to society.</dd>
                    <dt>Society:</dt>
                        <dd>people in general.</dd>
                </dl>
            <div>
                Therefore, "Social Media" truly means things/objects that are used for the particular purpose of connecting
                people (or their activities). The definition guides us to know that it serves to provide:
            </div>
                <ul class="box">
                    <li>Communication</li>
                    <li>News</li>
                    <li>Exchange of Information</li>
                    <li>Entertainment</li>
                    <li>Feedback</li>
                    <li>New Relationships</li>
                    <li>New Knowledge</li>
                </ul>
            <div>
                Social media has made life more enjoyable, interesting and easier. So why has it become a controversy being 
                mainly made out to be the villain? Because people naturally do not want to take responsibility, they instead
                point to and blame other things. The real villains are us, "Social" in Social Media is "People(us)" in general.  
            </div>
                <div class="box">
                    A famous saying goes,<br>"Villains are not born they are made."
                </div>
            <div>
                In that case "Entertainment" is the <big>factory</big>! Entertainment requires ideas, what happens when ideas
                run out? "<mark>Entertainers</mark>" become <i>desparate</i> for attention because it pays or gives them a 
                temporary sense of self-worth.
            </div>
                <div class="box">
                    Another famous saying,<br>"<i>Desparate</i> times call for <i>desparate</i> measures."
                </div>
            <div>
                These are little to no good content which the "<mark>Entertained</mark>" consume... this calls for another 
                quote!
            </div>
                <div class="box">
                    "You are what you eat."
                </div>
            <div>
                Not everyone is willing to cut themselves from social media because of the possible good or useful content there,
                but that runs out and when it does you keep on scrolling endlessly in hope to encounter good content("<span>Doom Scrolling!</span>")
                You become starved. "<mark>Entertainers'</mark>" <i>desparation</i> and the "<mark>Entertained's</mark>" starvation go 
                hand-in-hand. You start eating "<i>Bad Content</i>" and become depraved.  
            </div>
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                I believe it is best to remove 90% of Entertainment from the Social Media. Where will you get some entertainment?
                ...go read a book!, go play outside with friends and family, watch some television(not for prolonged periods of time),
                pick a hobby. In this way social media will mainly involve important information, communication, news, basically everything
                that does not require much user contribution(posts, stories, updates, blogs, -any personal/fictionalized content) and user 
                consumption. To understand what I mean think of a fast food drive through, social media being the fast food spot. You are 
                served then you go, no taking longer time to talk to the servers... <b>MOVE ON! YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED!</b>. 
                Just like this website, Goodbye and have a nice day!
