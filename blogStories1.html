        <br><h4>Introduction:</h4>
        <p>
            What if... You had the power to create? This is the question I kept on asking myself repeatedly. Until one day I decided that is exactly what I want to do but how would I gain this power? Engineering you might think, or even one of the arts. I too thought about it, engineering-Mechanical Engineering               was the choice. However, I realised that I would just be making machines, my desire was something a bit more like making it come to life! That is why I eventually chose computer science inorder to learn software programming(the use of instructional languages to tell the computer what to do, thus                   programming). I do not refer to languages such as "Greek", "Aramaic", "Latin" or even today's favorite  "English". The language I mean are those that speak to the computer/machines, what better way is there than to communicate with you creation for it to do exactly as you command it to do right? There              are various programming languages to choose from, some just help you to solve problems(High level), others help you solve problems and at the same time require you to know the computer and how it works(Low level), there are ofcourse extremes on either side however one that seems to fit in the middle                perfectly is "C Programming Language".

        <br><h4>C Programming Language:</h4>
        <p>
            This language is considered the "mother of all high-level programming languages" that are used today. Althought it is a high language it is close enough to the low level languages such as "Machine Language(written in 0s and 1s)" and "Assembly Language(written by making use of symbols that represent a               Machine language code". Therefore, C language has a balance as one hand allows programmers to focus on just solving a problem and the other to understand the underlying mechanisms within the computer system.
            Furthermore, C language has been used to create most of the important softwares(mySQL database; UNIX operating system; etc.) we use today that prove to be still relevent after many years when the language was made.
        </p>
        <br><h4>Challenges:</h4>
        <p>
            As stated before C is very close to Low level languages(which are considered more difficult to understand and use due to them being in a format that is less readable to humans. It requires patience and time. I find myself facing challenges in this language especially when I just want to make a program             that just solves a problem, within the program it might require some knowledge about how the computer system actually works internally that makes it possible for the program to be. Therefore, my focus is shifted from the problem itself to the computer system. A true fustration when there is not enough             time and life requires me to do other things. In today's time C is not widely used or receiving the right amount of respect, this is because jobs/employers may just want you to solve a problem without wasting time by having their employees try to figure out the computer system thus any High level                   language more of the ones further away from the Low level languages are required. I realised that programmers including me will end up losing the valuable skill of understanding the computer itself. Although I know one thing for sure, it is that once I master C language I will not only know how to                 solve problems by instructing computers/machines to execute their solutions but will also know the internal workings of them!
